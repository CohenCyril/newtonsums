# newtonsums
Newton series transformation destined to perform composed sums and products of polynomials in a fast way.
There is still a lot of polishing and documentation missing before it can be stable.
Please use with caution.


The following files are copied from Pierre Yves Strub development on elliptic curves, in order to support decomposition of polynomials in a decidable field:
xseq
polydec
polyall

The following files are copied and improved from the devlopment version of the mathematical components library:
polyorder
fraction
finmap

The following files are the core of the development on Newton series:

revpoly
